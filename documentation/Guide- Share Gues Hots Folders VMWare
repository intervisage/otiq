Came across this solution on VMware website:

    Open a root shell in the VM
    Make sure the /mnt/hgfs directory exists. If not, create it.
    Add the following line to /etc/fstab: vmhgfs-fuse /mnt/hgfs  fuse defaults,allow_other,_netdev   0   0
    Then reboot your VM. The shared folders should now appear at the mount point /mnt/hgfs
